# ORCA UE4 Sun Temple v3 StandardShader
#
# Adapts a copy version 3 of the UE4 Sun Temple assets from the NVIDIA's ORCA Project, which can be found at https://developer.nvidia.com/orca.
#
# Simply put, the assets aren't well formated for Unity, and I'm trying to change that. In this specific repo, I'm adapting the assets to Unity 2018.3 and HDRP. I used Unity's ShaderGraph to create shaders that work with the supplied textures. I wrote a besic fscene reader to pull the lighting inforation (it doesn't do everything that's need, but it does save a lot of time). And, I'm using the embeded prefab system to cut down on the amount of resoures that are being wasted on identical meshes.
#
# ORCA has some really nice assets, and I think that it's a shame that they don't work with Unity right out of the box.
